#Primary SQL Code for Data Manipulation and Retrieval for Data Analysis
#Querying Data Under Specific Conditions

SELECT [column_name] FROM [table1_name]
JOIN [table2_name] on [table1_name].[colunn_name] = [table2_name].[colunn_name]
WHERE [Condition];

#Types of the JOINs in SQL:
1. (INNER) JOIN: Returns records(rows) that have matching values in both tables
2. LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
3. RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
4. FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

#CASE expression goes through conditions and returns a value in a new column when the first condition is met.
#So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.
